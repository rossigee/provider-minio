Releasing a new version of the operator requires pushing a **new Git tag**, following the SemVer schema with a **`v` prefix**.
Optionally, for prereleases they may contain a ascending release candidate suffix with `-rc#`.

.Possible Operator Git tags
[example]
====
- `v0.1.2`
- `v1.4.0`
- `v2.0.0-rc1`
- `v2.0.0-rc2`
